# VS Code Workspace Recommendations

This repository includes a `.vscode/` folder with **recommended extensions**
commonly needed when working on the Dev Workstation Kit and connected projects.

## Why recommendations only?
- No extensions are auto-installed
- No intrusive formatting rules
- Safe for mixed PHP / JS / Docker projects

## Included extension groups

### PHP
- Intelephense (PHP language server)
- Xdebug debugger
- PHP DocBlock helper

### Frontend
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Stylelint
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

### DevOps / Tooling
- Docker
- YAML
- Makefile tools
- dotenv support

### Git / DX
- GitLens
- Error Lens

You can safely ignore or remove any recommendation.


## Tasks
This repo also includes `.vscode/tasks.json` so you can run DevKit commands from **Run Task...**.
